This file completely replaces your existing site. All prior code is superseded.
It uses:

1. **Next.js** (React-based, with file-based routing).
2. **Tailwind CSS** (for rapid and consistent UI styling).
3. A custom neon/glow aesthetic and layout reminiscent of the original Xbox home screen (dark background, bright green highlights) and a “Nous-style” cinematic sense of immersion.

**Key Points**:
- The “blog” pages (under `/blog`) have dynamic routes `[slug].jsx`. You can easily fetch Markdown files or GitHub content. For demonstration, the code is set up to fetch from an imaginary data source (you can adapt).
- “Projects” and “About” are placeholders that you can expand with real content or data fetching.
- We added subtle neon glow states in `globals.css` and in Tailwind config (for the brand color).
- Animations are optional. The example includes a mild “pulse” or “zoom” effect for hover states. You can enhance them further if desired.
- This code is ready to parse with your `decompile_code.py` script if you save it as `all_new_code.txt`. Once processed, you can run `npm install` (or `yarn`) inside the new folder and then `npm run dev` to spin up your new Next.js site.
