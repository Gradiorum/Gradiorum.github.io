This file completely replaces your existing site. All prior code is superseded.
It uses:

1. **Next.js** (React-based, with file-based routing).
2. **Tailwind CSS** (for rapid and consistent UI styling).
3. A custom neon/glow aesthetic reminiscent of the original Xbox home screen (dark background, bright green highlights).

**Key Points**:
- We removed **all** `@/` alias references and replaced them with **relative imports**.
- “Blog” pages are in `/blog/[slug].jsx`.
- “Projects” and “About” are placeholders you can expand with real content or data fetching.
- The code is ready for your `decompile_code.py` if you save it as `all_new_code_no_aliases.txt`.
