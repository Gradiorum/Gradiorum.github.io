## William’s Journey and Our Vision

**By: William (Founder)**

As I prepare to embark on my Master of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech this coming January, specializing in Machine Learning, I’m reminded of the broader goal we hold at Gradiorum: bringing personalized AI assistants into everyday life.

From early forays into reinforcement learning to the nuanced complexities of human-AI teaming, our mission is rooted in practical innovation. Soon, I will be immersing myself in advanced coursework and research at one of the world’s leading institutions. This step is not just academic—it's a move towards realizing our dream: making AI assistants as ubiquitous and helpful as any common household technology.

**Blog Roles at Gradiorum:**

- **Founder (like me, William)**: We shape the strategic direction and share our vision.
- **Members**: Our verified contributors who add depth to projects and research discussions.
- **Guests**: Occasional voices from the larger tech and AI ecosystem. Guest posts are carefully verified before publication to ensure quality and relevance.

We look forward to sharing insights, updates, and breakthroughs. Thank you for joining us on this journey.
